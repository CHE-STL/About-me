    <h1> About me </h1>

    Hello, my name is Ch√© and I am looking to apply to Founder and Coders apprenticeship because I feel it is the perfect place to kickstart my career. My passion for technology started at a young age, 
    my older sister and I were gifted a silver Nintendo DS which at the time, was the most impressive item we had in our collection. As my passion for gaming and tech grew 
    I began to notice issues such as the Wi-Fi connections and the lack of storage for multiple games. To solve these problems, I would research countless ways to make the
    gaming experience, connectivity, and other aspects of technology better for my household. Eventually, I would have the responsibility of trying to help my parents set up
     any new devices in the house and troubleshooting if they had any challenges. To keep pushing myself,  I like to use websites such as Udemy to learn languages such as Python 
     and JavaScript.  Last year in November I graduated from the university of Kent with a degree in Human Geography.
     As I continued to do more research into the different avenues of tech I began to have a big interest
     in both front and back end development which led me to upskill using the Generation programme.

    <p> During my time on the Generation programme, I gained insight into what it would be like to work as an Azure Cloud Platform Engineer and learned about the various ways in which 
    an ACPE would expect to complete tasks daily. The programme has improved my approach to challenging tasks when dealing with unexpected errors across different platforms such as 
    Linux, PowerShell, and languages including Python.  By improving my technical ability I have reignited my passion and steered it in the direction of a career in cloud computing. 
    I have previously worked with many retail stores as a sales assistant honing my interpersonal skills such as communication with both customers and colleagues and teamwork. 
    Working with a large group of people has given me experience in how to take on a leadership role to meet deadlines making me a well-rounded individual.

    <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
     Currently I am working on a project that uses HTML,CSS and JavaScript to make a website that contains a small number of games.
     I have already completed one Lucky numbers game and plan to continue adding to the collection with a rock,paper, scissors game
     that I am now working on. Outside of programming, I am a sporty person with foorball (I support Mancherster United), swimming 
     and table tennis being my top choice when I have free time. However, if I am  not being active I do enjoy playing video games.
